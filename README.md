# Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Airline-Passenger-Traffic-Dataset



- Analyzed historical monthly airline passenger data to uncover trends and patterns in air travel.
- Performed data preprocessing, visualization, and decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals).
- Applied forecasting models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet to predict future passenger counts.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
- Visualized actual vs. predicted passenger traffic and interpreted results for actionable insights.
